# Collaborative genetic studies of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. It is believed that the damage to the alveolar epithelium is followed by an aberrant wound healing response leading to the deposition of dense fibrotic tissue, reducing the lungs’ flexibility and inhibiting gas transfer. IPF still has limited therapeutic interventions and a high mortality rate within 3-5 years from diagnosis.

To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IPF susceptibility have associated common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]>5%) near genes involved in host defence, telomere maintenance, cell-cell adhesion and signalling in disease susceptibility. Common variants near MUC5B and TOLLIP genes also show association with survival time after diagnosis of IPF (1,2).

# Meta-analysis of GWAS of IPF susceptibility
Building up on published GWAS results (1,3,4) and novel study samples, we have performed the largest GWAS of IPF susceptibility to date (5) to identify novel genes and further advance in the understanding of IPF pathogenesis and risk. The discovery stage of the study comprised up to 2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls and replication was pursued in an additional 1,467 IPF cases and 11,874 controls.

**Sample sizes for genome-wide analyses**

## Access to the results of this study
To help advance IPF research and allow the wider research community to access to the most accurate effect sizes for genetic variants on a genome-wide scale, the variant summary data resulting from this meta-analysis (1.31 Gb) can be accessed after an internal assessment of formal requests received.

## What type of results would be made available?
No individual level data will be made available. Granted requests will have access to a file with the GWAS meta-analysis variant summary data with information for the following descriptors:

   •	**rsid**
   
   •	**chromosome_position**
      [According to GRCh37/hg19 reference]
      
   •	**non_effect_allele**
   
   •	**effect_allele**
   
   •	**effect_allele_frequency**
      [Frequency taken from across all three studies included in the meta-analysis]
      
   •	**studies_included**
      [This is a piece of text that is Y if it is in the study and N if it is not. For example if the variant was in all three       studies it would read Y:Y:Y (with UK first, Chicago second and Colorado last), if it was in the UK and Chicago but not         included in Colorado it would read Y:Y:N]
      
   •	**imputation_quality_by_study**
      [The imputation r2 by study in the same order as the studies_included column]
      
   •	**effect_direction_by_study**
      [A piece of text with a plus sign (+) if the effect allele was associated with an increased risk of IPF (i.e. beta > 0)         and a minus sign (–) if associated with a decreased risk of IPF (i.e. beta < 0) by study. For example if the effect           allele had lower risk in the UK study but higher risk in the Chicago and Colorado studies it would read -:+:+]
      
   •	**beta**
      [This is the beta from the meta-analysis]
      
   •	**standard_error**
      [This is the standard error from the meta-analysis]
      
   •	**p**
      [This is the p value from the meta-analysis]

## Who should I contact for requesting access to the data?
Requesters should contact **`GWASIPF.adm@gmail.com`** for requesting access to the data. Designated delegates of this collaborative effort will review the requests. Within a few days, an email with the instructions for data downloading will be obtained in response.

## Which information should I submit to access the variant summary data?
Requesters should provide a signed document including the following information: full name and title of the PI, affiliation, and a brief description of the project and the aims where the data is to be used. 

The document should explicitly state that the data requester also agrees to: use the data only as part of that indicated research, not redistribute the data outside the project without permission, acknowledge the provenance of the data in any dissemination of results.

A template document for the request is [here](https://github.com/genomicsITER/PFgenetics/blob/master/Request_template.txt).
